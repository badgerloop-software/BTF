## Code Review Etiquette
#### Assignees
- Do not resolve threads started by a reviewer. After making changes that you believe resolve a reviewer's suggestion, please reply to the thread saying so. The reviewer will look at your changes and either resolve the thread or provide additional feedback.
- Please be sure to read comments from reviewers in their entirety. Sometimes, there is more than one suggestion in a single comment.
- If your changes are not quite ready to be merged, mark the pull request as "Draft" so that the reviewer knows that you are still making changes.
- Although it's not necessary, depending on the reviewer, it could be helpful to send the reviewer a message when you add them to the PR in case they miss the email notification about your request for review.

#### Reviewers
- Don't be shy. Code reviews are meant to refine and finalize changes before merging them, so any and all suggestions are welcome.
- Try to leave constructive reviews. Focus on what improvements could be made rather than what mistakes need to be fixed.
- If you see room for improvement that might be outside of the scope of the PR, rather than asking the assignee to make changes, spawn a new issue in Jira. If you are not a team lead, bring it up to your lead so that they can add the issue.
